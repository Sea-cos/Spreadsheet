**JavaScript Spreadsheet Implementation**

This is a JavaScript-based spreadsheet implementation that allows users to create and edit formulas, perform calculations, and manipulate data. The system consists of several components, including infix evaluation, high-precedence operations, spreadsheet functions, formula evaluation, range expansion, and cell references.

**Features**
* Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
* Implements various spreadsheet functions (e.g., sum, average, median)
* Handles high-precedence operations correctly
* Allows users to reference cells using letters and numbers
* Supports range references and expansion
* Evaluates formulas and updates cell values accordingly

**Technical Details**
* Written in JavaScript
* Uses regular expressions for parsing and evaluating formulas
* Utilizes the replace() method to evaluate formulas and update cell values
* Employs a recursive approach to handle nested function calls and range expansions
